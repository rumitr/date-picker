# test1
This is the first task of the final project for WOTR

Specifications
1. User is asked to enter sowing date of crop and expected duration.
2. Today’s date (system date) is selected by default and user can change if he/she wants to.
3. Today’s date which is selected is visible on the screen near the center and not hidden. It shows 27 Oct,
2019. If today’s date is 27th January, January is then visible and 27th is also in the view in the date
scroll.
4. Only one screen is to be developed. Selected date and duration is shown on the next page on clicking
Next below.

Reasoning: 
The requirements mentioned two seperate screens but the page width was too big and that is why i showed both the selector and output pane on the same page.

All the other specifications are completed.
